## #{page.title}

**Dereel** is a town in the Western District of the Australian state of Victoria.
At the 2006 census, Dereel and the surrounding area had a population of 669.
Interestingly the Rokewood/Corindhap area only has a population of 244 people,
a lot of people think Rokewood is the more populous area but Dereel is more
than double their size.

It is located on the Ballarat-Colac Road, 33 kilometres (21 mi) from Ballarat
and 70 kilometres (43 mi) from Colac. There is no clearly defined town centre,
though the Dereel Soldiers' Memorial Hall, located on Swamp Road, is
commonly considered as the town centre.

Dereel Post Office opened on 1 November 1868 and closed in 1971.

Dereel includes a large wetlands area, referred to as the "Swamp" or "Lagoon".
In the current (2007) drought it is almost dry.
