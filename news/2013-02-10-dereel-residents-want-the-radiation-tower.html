After Wendy's interview with WIN News, a number of people were upset that only the opponents of the NBN tower got air time.  Greg Nyary did something about it: he called up WIN and asked them to interview the people in favour of the tower.  There was no mention of it here, but on 29 January the WIN team came down to interview the people in favour.  Despite lack of publicity, 50 or 60 people came.  More information in <a href="http://www.lemis.com/grog/diary-jan2013.php#D-20130130-024316">my diary</a><br>
<br>
Only one problem: WIN news wasn't happy about the video of Wendy's news item being published on this site, which is why Scott took it down.  But it also means that the new item for the proponents can't be put up.  Did anybody keep a copy?<br>
