I'm sure everyone is getting tired of this topic but just a reminder to people that the VCAT hearing in regard to our NBN tower is scheduled for the 24th of April at 10am in Ballarat, that's less than 10 days away. I have heard some rumours being spread that the complaint had been withdrawn but I just rang VCAT and they have assured me that no such withdrawal is showing on their system and that the hearing is still going ahead as planned. I will definitely be attending the hearing.
