title: "Why logically the Rokewood tower won't help Dereel."

Some people in Dereel seem to think a tower in Rokewood is going to help us here in Dereel.  Well a picture tells a thousand words, and here's a picture screaming that <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/goh9">Wendy McClelland</a> doesn't make any sense.<br>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://dereel.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/WendyIsWrongAgain.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-401" title="WendyIsWrongAgain" src="http://dereel.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/WendyIsWrongAgain-1024x337.png" alt="" width="600" height="197" /></a></p><br>
<p style="text-align: left;">All it is is a simple elevation map showing the location of the tower and how it would have to send signals through the earth to get to Dereel.  Even if you forget for a second that mobile phone towers have their antenna's slightly directed downwards it is impossible this tower is going to help us.  Wendy is wrong again.</p>
