After the smear campaign that Wendy and Stewart McClelland have launched, I thought I'd go and see what new "evidence" they have come up with.  But their site is not reachable: they've used up their bandwidth limit.  Clearly they got more interest than they expected.  If anybody has accessed it, and they have any new information (plausible or not), could you let us know?<br>
