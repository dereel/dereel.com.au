Actually no.  The term microwave is simply an easy way for us to refer to all radio wave frequencies between 300MHz and 300GHz.  A microwave oven (which people assume is the same thing as any microwave radio frequency) can only cook things because of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_heating">dielectric heating</a> of water atoms.<!--more--> Radio waves from a mobile phone, TV or radio tower that transmit in the microwave range do not cause <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_heating">dielectric heating</a> and anyone who tells you they do doesn't understand basic physics.
