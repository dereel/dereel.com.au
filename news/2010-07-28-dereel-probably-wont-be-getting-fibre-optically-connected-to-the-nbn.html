title: "Dereel probably won't be getting fibre optically connected to the NBN"

<blockquote><strong>The nano fibre optic cabling</strong><strong></strong> is currently being rolled out by the Government.  It is designed for extremely fast broadband services which are faster than wireless connections and replaces the old phone line connection.  The other option is the satellite broadband connection.</blockquote><br>
There is no such thing as <em>"nano fibre optic cabling"</em> (again <a href="http://savedereel.com">DATA</a> have no idea what the words they are using mean).<!--more--><br>
<br>
The <a href="http://www.nbn.gov.au">NBN</a> rollout will be replacing peoples copper wires used for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_switched_telephone_network">PSTN</a> services with fibre optic cables (note, they aren't <strong>nano</strong>) however there is only a very slim chance that this will happen in Dereel - only 90% of Australia will get fibre to their homes.  Considering how far we are from our local exchange (in Corindhap) it's unlikely <a href="http://www.nbnco.com.au">NBNco</a> will replace our copper.  So what will we get instead? Well we will be getting next generation wireless connections.  That's 4G (aka <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3GPP_Long_Term_Evolution">LTE</a>).  So when the <a href="http://www.nbn.gov.au">NBN</a> does eventually get here <a href="http://savedereel.com">DATA</a> will lose again and we'll get another tower (and I'm sure they'll attempt to block Dereel getting connected to the <a href="http://www.nbn.gov.au">NBN</a> as well).<br>
<br>
In any case the <a href="http://www.nbn.gov.au">NBN</a> has nothing at all to do with mobile telephony, we don't only want a mobile tower for internet services, we want it for mobile phone services.  <a href="http://savedereel.com">DATA</a> is just trying to distract you, and yet again prove they have no idea what they are talking about.
