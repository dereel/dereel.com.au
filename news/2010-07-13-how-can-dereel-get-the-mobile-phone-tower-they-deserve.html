title: "How can Dereel get the mobile phone tower they deserve?"

I have talked with our regional managers in Optus and Telstra to find out what they think on this matter.<!--more--><br>
<br>
Both Optus and Telstra admit that Dereel is in dire need of a mobile phone tower and that they have both on different occasions in the course of the last few years tried to install towers but sadly there was no community support and the projects were axed.  Optus and Telstra have told me that they are willing to share a tower to reduce the impact on our community but that we as a community need to tell them where we would like it installed.  I can understand that people have fears about installing a tower right beside the playground at the community centre so the ball is in our court to decide where we would like our tower.<br>
<br>
We also need a handfull of people from the community to write letters of support for a mobile tower being installed in Dereel.  Currently the only letters that Optus and Telstra have received are letters against the tower which I am sure is not an accurate cross section of our community.  Of the over 700 people residing in Dereel a handful of misinformed people are blocking our ability to have a tower and all the benefits that come with it (mobile reception, wireless broadband internet, etc.)<br>

Add your comments below about where you think it's best to install a mobile tower and if you're willing to write a letter of support please state it in the comments and I will contact you with details on where to send the letter.
