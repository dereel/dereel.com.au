title: NBN tower is erected

A month to the day after we reported that the foundations were in we
now have our *radiation tower* proudly standing. It will still be
some time before we'll be able to sign up for NBN service (the equipment
building still isn't on site for example) but I think the estimate NBNco
initially offered us is still viable: **NBN service by the end of the year**.
This will certainly make a good Christmas present for Dereel residents.
