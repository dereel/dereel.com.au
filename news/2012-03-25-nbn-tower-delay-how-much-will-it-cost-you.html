title: "NBN tower delay: how much will it cost you?"
author: Greg Lehey

On Tuesday the Golden Plains Shire Council will decide on whether to approve the planning application for the NBN communications tower.  I have little doubt that it will be approved, and if there are no further objections, the tower could be up and running by the end of June.<br>
<br>
But that seems unlikely.  The <a href="http://www.savedereel.com/">"Dereel Anti-Tower Alliance"</a> is likely to complain to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Civil_and_Administrative_Tribunal">VCAT</a>.  I have little doubt that here, too, the complaint will be dismissed, but only after about 6 months.  In that time we will have the same old network and telephone service.<br>
<br>
How much will that cost us?  For me, it's about $730.  See <a href="http://wwww.lemis.com/grog/diary-mar2012.php#NBN-delay-cost">my diary</a> for more details.  Nearly 100 households answered in favour of the tower; many more will benefit by it.  So: do the sums.  How much will the NBN save you?  How much of these savings will you lose because of people tilting at windmills?<br>
