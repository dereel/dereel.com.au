Unfortunately that doesn't seem to work.  I put in a comment, but the moderator doesn't seem to have liked it, so it hasn't been published.  But nobody moderates my <a href="http://www.lemis.com/grog/diary-mar2013.php#NBN-scam" title="diary">diary</a>, so you can read it there.<br>
<br>
Basically, it seems that satellite is far superior to fixed wireless, and the NBN has been conning us so that they can install smart meters.  Haven't we seen all this before?<br>
