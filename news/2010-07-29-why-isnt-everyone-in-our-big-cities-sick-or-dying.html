title: "Why isn't everyone in our big cities sick or dying?"

<a href="http://savedereel.com">DATA</a> want us to believe that mobile phone towers make us sick, that they make animals sick and that ultimately they will lead to our early demise. Well if that's true then surely an area that is literally blanketed in mobile towers would be impossible to live in, right?<!--more--><br>
<br>
Here is an image from <a href="http://cellsite.nudge.id.au/">cellsite.nudge.id.au</a> which has a map of mobile towers in Melbourne:<br>

You can't even see the CBD. If there was any evidence to support <a href="http://savedereel.com">DATA</a>'s case you'd think people wouldn't be able to work in the CBD of Melbourne and yet they do, every single day of the year. Millions of people and thousands of mobile phone towers all living and working in perfect harmony.<br>
<br>
For comparison here is what our area looks like:<br>

Take a close look at the scale of those maps (in the bottom left corner).<br>

Let's use our common sense on this issue.
