The WHO today published a <a href="http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf">press release</a> saying that electromagnetic fields are <em>possibly</em> carcinogenic.  They put them into the group: <em>Possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B)</em>.  You know what else is in Group 2B?  <a href="http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Classification/ClassificationsGroupOrder.pdf">Coffee and Pickled Vegetables</a>.   I'm sure Wendy will go crazy over this latest release, personally I'm still drinking coffee, eating pickled gherkins and I'm sure as hell still using my mobile phone.  The simple fact still acknowledged by the WHO is that rates of GBM cancer have not gone up in recent years despite a dramatic rise in phone use since the 1980s.
