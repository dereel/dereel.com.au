Good news everyone! I stopped into the VCAT offices this morning while I was
in Ballarat to check if a decision had been made for our NBN tower (VCAT P1260/2012)
and I was surprised to hear that it had been made and it was made in the favour of
the applicants (i.e. Wendy has lost her objection) and the tower will soon
begin construction. I was unable to get a copy of the order (as it is only available
to directly involved parties at the moment) but the chairman re-asserted the councils
orders to paint the tower and ensure that the base of the tower is kept neat and tidy
(i.e. landscaped) and that the nearby (dying) large cypress/pine trees are kept (plus
other requirements but none of them were surprising or onerous). Hopefully the full
text of the order will be available on the AustLII website within a week or two.
