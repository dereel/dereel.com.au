title: The NBN is coming to Dereel

Good news everyone! I stopped into the VCAT offices this morning while I was in
Ballarat to check if a decision had been made for our NBN tower (VCAT
P1268/2012) and I was surprised to hear that it had and it was made in the
favour of the applicants (i.e. Wendy has lost her objection). Basically our
tower is now clear to begin construction. I was unable to get a copy of the
order (as it is only available to directly involved parties at the moment) but
the chairman re-asserted the councils orders to paint the tower and ensure that
the base of the tower is kept neat and tidy (i.e. landscaped) and that the
nearby (dying) large cypress/pine trees are kept (plus other requirements but
none of them were surprising or onerous). Hopefully the full text of the order
will be available on the [AustLII](http://www.austlii.edu.au) website within a
week or two. According to VCAT the decision was passed down on the 17th, so all
parties should be aware by now.
