The person is so convinced that the tablet or surgery or device they are given will cure them that it actually does. But were you aware that there is an opposite effect to? It's call the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocebo">nocebo</a> effect. In this case the person has so convinced themselves that a medicine or surgery or invisible microwave is causing them harm that the body actually manifests real symptoms - in other words they worry themselves sick when there is actually no root cause other than their own thoughts.<br>

Something to think about.
