title: Update regarding Dereel's NBN tower
author: Scott Weston

NBNco have indicated that construction of our tower should start next week
(19th August, 2013). The one month estimate for how long it would take to do
all the paperwork was ambitious but it will be good to see work starting on
the site very soon.

In other news it appears Wendy McClelland has allowed the 
[savedereel.com](http://savedereel.com) domain to expire, you can of course
still read archives of her site on
[the Internet Archive Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/20130617201047/http://savedereel.com/)
if you so desire.
