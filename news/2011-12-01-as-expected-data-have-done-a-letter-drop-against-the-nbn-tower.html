If you want Dereel to join the 21st century then you should go to the information sessions and voice your approval, you can bet Wendy McClelland and her band of followers will be there protesting it and if protesting is all NBNco see then they very well might pick another town.<br>
<br>
As we have already reported the Rokewood tower is already live and has not improved mobile phone coverage one tiny bit in Dereel, as we were told by the experts in the field (actual mobile network engineers, not some misguided woman who likely failed high school physics).<br>
<br>
The fact is that there are tens of thousands of these towers around Australia and in our capital cities and people aren't any more sick than they were 20 years ago (before mobile phones) in fact we are all much healthier than ever, our dogs, cats, birds, bees and livestock are all fine.  We still seem to have honey, farming and fruit industries booming despite Wendy McClelland's claims that communications towers are adversely affecting all living things. Wendy McClelland keeps making these dire, unsubstantiated and hysterical claims and yet if you just look at what she is saying it is obviously all completely false, easily disproven by a little bit of research.
