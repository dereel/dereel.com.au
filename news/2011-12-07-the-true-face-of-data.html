title: "The true face of \"DATA\"?"
author: Greg Lehey

I've wondered aloud in the past about how many people belong to the "Dereel Anti-Tower Alliance" or "DATA".  After yesterday's NBN information session, ABC news published this <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-12-07/couple-fears-nbn-tower-radiation/3717116">news report</a>.  OK, they misspelt the McClellands' name, but clearly they have interviewed them.  And who is worried about the pulsating microwave tower?  "DATA"?  No, just Wendy and Stuart.<br>
<br>
I think this is significant.  They want to go to court, and the success of their case will depend on the number of people who put their name to it.  Clearly they would have given as much information as possible about their supporters, if there are any.  This article suggests either that they're acting alone, or that the ABC didn't consider their "supporters" to be real supporters.<br>
