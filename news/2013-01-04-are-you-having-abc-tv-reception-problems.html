title: "Are you having ABC TV reception problems?"
author: Greg Lehey

For the past 3 months or so I've had particularly poor reception of ABC TV.  Other channels aren't affected.  I've called ABC on 1300 13 9994, and they don't want to know because we're in a marginal area, as they put it (the Digital TV taskforce thinks we're in a good reception area).  So ABC says it must be my fault.  That would change if other people also have problems.  If this affects you, all you need to do is to call them up and tell them.  The more people call, the sooner things will get fixed.<br>
