I've heard from somebody at NBN telling me that they're planning fixed wireless Internet access in Dereel. They're planning an information session in the Hall on 6 December. It seems there are two separate sessions of 2 hours each, one from 2 to 4 pm, and the other from 6 to 8 pm. See <a href="http://www.lemis.com/grog/Day/20111129/NBN-info-session.pdf">here</a> for more details.<br>
