So far this site really does look a little one-sided.  That's not Scott's fault; nobody else has brought up any other topics.  But there's an election coming up, and I have a number of axes to grind.  Apart from mobile broadband coverage, there's the NBN (no surprise that Dereel doesn't show anywhere in today's announcement), fire danger, electricity supply reliability and TV coverage.  Neither of the main candidates has addressed any of them, including the topics that we've been discussing here, but they're more receptive than at any other time.<br>
<br>
I've sent letters to <a href="mailto:darren.cheeseman.mp@aph.gov.au">Darren Cheeseman</a> and <a href="mailto:sarah.henderson@vic.liberal.org.au">Sarah Henderson</a> voicing my concerns.  They're online at <a href="http://www.lemis.com/grog/Day/20100730/Cheeseman.u7u.pdf">http://www.lemis.com/grog/Day/20100730/Cheeseman.u7u.pdf</a> and <a href="http://www.lemis.com/grog/Day/20100730/Henderson.u7u.pdf">http://www.lemis.com/grog/Day/20100730/Henderson.u7u.pdf</a>.<br>
<br>
I'd suggest that other people on the list do this as well.  Feel free to copy parts or even all of my text if you want to, but consider that it will have more of an impact if we don't just all send the same message.<br>
