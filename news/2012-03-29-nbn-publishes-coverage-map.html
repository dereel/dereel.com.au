title: "NBN publishes coverage map"

I've just become aware of a <a href="http://www.nbnco.com.au/rollout/rollout-map.html">new NBN rollout map</a>.  It shows not only the current state of the rollout, but also the planned coverage.  Enter "Dereel" to see the situation here.  It seems that the term "work commenced" includes the work that the NBN people have done to get the project rolling: for Dereel, "work" started in July 2011.<br>
<br>
More importantly, though, not all of Dereel will be covered according to this map.  I'm OK, and even Progress Road is marginally covered, but coverage stops just down Rokewood Junction Road.  It's worth taking a look.<br>
