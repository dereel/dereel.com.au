<blockquote>At the hearing, the applicants/objectors may only rely upon relevant planning matters and not those grounds ruled to be not relevant.</blockquote><br>
It's a dry read but quite interesting, it's very clear that VCAT will in no way let Wendy say that the towers have a health impact and she can only object on Visual Impact, Noise, Amenity, Access and Compliance with State and Local planning policy.<br>

edit: For reasons yet to be determined the VCAT hearing notes have been "moved" from the AustLII site, for the time being the text of the hearing can be found here: <a href="http://pastebin.com/kZtLnYgn">http://pastebin.com/kZtLnYgn</a>
