Have you seen an improvement in your signal coverage?  The tower has been active since the 17th of October (over a month now) and I have not seen even a single dB improvement on my mobile phone, just as all those network engineers told us.  Yet again we've got more rock solid proof that Wendy McClelland does not have a clue about what she is talking about, I still have to walk half way down my driveway to receive SMS codes just to do my Internet banking.<br>
