The Rokewood tower construction has begun and it looks like it might not be much of a wait for completion.  If you'd like to visit the tower it's at the corner of Dark Ln and Halls Hill Rd.  I've been assured by Telstra that Dereel is high in their priority list and we should hear more about our tower soon.  In the meantime the tower in Rokewood will hopefully help those of us who are using external antennas to improve our mobile reception.[gallery link="file" columns="2"]
