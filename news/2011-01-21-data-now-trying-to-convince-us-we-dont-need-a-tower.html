title: "DATA now trying to convince us we don't need a tower"

Here is the latest attempt by DATA to stop Dereel getting a mobile phone tower. Here again we see them not understanding the issue and trying to trick you.<!--more--><br>

Firstly the Rokewood tower will not improve mobile phone service in Dereel. I know this because I have called our area managers at Optus and at Telstra and talked to them. Both managers have admitted that Dereel needs its own tower. Mobile phone towers cost a lot of money to install and these employees would lose their jobs if they just installed towers where they weren't needed. Think logically, would Optus and Telstra want to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on a tower that wasn't necessary? They are private companies, not government funded - so no, they would not.<br>
<br>
DATA again show their ignorance. Mobile phone towers do not provide "WiFi" signals. Their ignorance of the issues they claim to know so much about really is going beyond a joke. In other literature they claim that mobile phones can make calls via satellites. They've also made the claim that multimeters can be used to read your resistance to radiation.<br>
<br>
Lastly DATA seem to think that the NBN and mobile phone service are the same thing. I don't want a mobile phone tower for broadband, that is just a bonus. I want a mobile phone tower so I can use my mobile phone. It's not rocket science. In any case Dereel will not be getting fibre optic cables - this has already been covered many many times and if DATA would do just basic researched they'd know this too.
