Malcolm Turnbull today announced 499 government, council and telco funded
mobile phone services to be deployed around the country to address blackspots
and we're happy to say that [Dereel is covered](http://nationalmap.gov.au/#start=%7B%22version%22%3A%220.0.04%22%2C%22initSources%22%3A%5B%22init%2Fnm.json%22%2C%7B%22catalog%22%3A%5B%7B%22name%22%3A%22National%20Data%20Sets%22%2C%22items%22%3A%5B%7B%22name%22%3A%22Communications%22%2C%22items%22%3A%5B%7B%22name%22%3A%22Mobile%20Black%20Spot%20Programme%20-%20Funded%20Base%20Stations%22%2C%22nowViewingIndex%22%3A0%2C%22isEnabled%22%3Atrue%2C%22isShown%22%3Atrue%2C%22isLegendVisible%22%3Atrue%2C%22opacity%22%3A0.6%2C%22keepOnTop%22%3Afalse%2C%22disableUserChanges%22%3Afalse%2C%22tableStyle%22%3A%7B%22imageUrl%22%3A%22images%2Fsquare.png%22%2C%22colorMap%22%3A%5B%7B%22color%22%3A%22rgba(255%2C%20255%2C%20255%2C1.00)%22%2C%22offset%22%3A0%7D%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D%5D%7D%5D%2C%22catalogOnlyUpdatesExistingItems%22%3Atrue%7D%2C%7B%22initialCamera%22%3A%7B%22west%22%3A143.7423911676064%2C%22south%22%3A-37.823108467007145%2C%22east%22%3A143.76313595989205%2C%22north%22%3A-37.79818335977332%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22x%22%3A-4070688.0334033985%2C%22y%22%3A2984450.064501844%2C%22z%22%3A-3890540.3127197684%7D%2C%22direction%22%3A%7B%22x%22%3A0.6387505542704373%2C%22y%22%3A-0.4683039125696007%2C%22z%22%3A0.6104827392246566%7D%2C%22up%22%3A%7B%22x%22%3A-0.49233792193664316%2C%22y%22%3A0.3609605872086582%2C%22z%22%3A0.7920295607582887%7D%7D%2C%22homeCamera%22%3A%7B%22west%22%3A109%2C%22south%22%3A-45%2C%22east%22%3A158%2C%22north%22%3A-8%7D%2C%22baseMapName%22%3A%22Bing%20Maps%20Aerial%20with%20Labels%22%2C%22viewerMode%22%3A%223d%22%7D%5D%7D).

After listening to [Malcolm's Google+ announcement](https://plus.google.com/+MalcolmTurnbull/posts/KouaoJqmDuQ)
it seems likely that Telstra plan to put their service on the existing NBN tower
in our town. This means it is highly unlikely to require planning permission and
there will be nothing that certain residents will be able to do to try and stop
the installation.

Let's hope our service is operational before the next bushfire season.
