<img class="alignleft" title="Electromagnetic Imagination" src="http://sanatio.net/data/images/nervenzellen.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="135" />Many studies have been made on the claims made by people who say they are sensitive to electromagnetic radiation.  Not a single study has been able to show that these people are suffering from a real ailment.<!--more--> You can read all about it on <a title="The truth about electromagnetic hypersensitivity" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_hypersensitivity">wikipedia</a>.  We shouldn't let this unfounded fear stop Dereel having a mobile phone tower.  I agree that the original location at the CFA building next to the children's playground was not ideal but I'm sure we as a community can find a good alternate location.<br>
<br>
If for nothing else we need this tower for our own safety, we are listed as a community at <a href="http://www.cfaconnect.net.au/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=788:help-for-high-risk-communities&amp;Itemid=42">high risk of being destroyed by a major bush fire</a> and we don't have a designated evacuation point.  If we add to that not having any mobile phone coverage it's a recipe for disaster.
