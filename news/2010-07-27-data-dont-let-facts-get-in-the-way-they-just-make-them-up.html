title: "DATA don't let facts get in the way, they just make them up"

One of the more disgusting lies that <a href="http://savedereel.com">DATA</a> published is the following:<br>
<blockquote><strong>The World Health Organization (WHO)</strong> is funded by the Telecommunications Industry and Governments, so is not an independent organization, and has a vested interest in protecting their industry</blockquote><br>
If you would like to know the truth you can simply read the <a href="http://who.int">WHO</a>'s budget, <a href="http://www.who.int/about/resources_planning/en/index.html">it is published and public</a> and you'll see they are not funded by the telecommunications industry and governments, they are funded by a lot more than that.  Because <a href="http://savedereel.com">DATA</a> can't actually refute the findings of the <a href="http://who.int">WHO</a> they try and disparage them by mud flinging and implying that they are not impartial. Instead what we see here is <a href="http://savedereel.com">DATA</a> flat out lying to you.  Clearly <a href="http://savedereel.com">DATA</a> can't be trusted, I strongly suggest you don't take anything they say at face value and that you do your own research.
