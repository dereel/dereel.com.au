title: "Around 70% of people want Dereel to have a tower"

You will notice that the main poll (Should Dereel have a mobile phone tower?) has now been closed. It's been running for 2 weeks and that seems like long enough. Looking at the logs there were many votes from outside Victoria (Queensland, NSW and SA) so it appears some people have been trying to skew the results. Voting in polls will now require a <a href="http://dereel.com.au/wp-login.php?action=register">registered account</a> to help reduce this sort of abuse in the future, and just like what all the big news organisations say:<br>
<blockquote>Polls are not scientific and reflect the opinion only of visitors who have chosen to participate.</blockquote>
