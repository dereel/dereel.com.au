title: "Previous VCAT hearings about communications towers"
author: Scott Weston

I've been reading up on past VCAT hearings about communications towers that have been objected to by residents claiming "<em>visual impact</em>" and "<em>health concerns</em>". They can be found via the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VCAT/">AustLII search page</a> (search for "<em>communications tower</em>" or "<em>telecommunications facility</em>"). You will be pleased to hear that VCAT <strong>consistently</strong> approves the towers, four key points I see repeated are:<br>
<ol><br>
	<li>There is strong State policy support for improved telecommunications facilities if, when balancing improved telecommunications services with environmental (including visual) impact, a particular proposal provides a net community benefit.</li><br>
	<li>The Commonwealth communications regulator adopts radiations standards established by ARPANSA. The Tribunal has consistently held it must apply this standard.</li><br>
	<li>The impact on adjacent land is not unreasonable.</li><br>
	<li>The facility has a net community benefit and is an acceptable planning outcome.</li><br>
</ol><br>

I find it difficult to believe that the very few objectors in our community will in any way be able to stop our communications tower being built. If you're interested I suggest reading the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/cases/vic/VCAT/2009/2120.html?stem=0&amp;synonyms=0&amp;query=haddon%20telecommunications">VCAT hearing regarding the Haddon telecommunications facility that was built recently in our shire</a>.
