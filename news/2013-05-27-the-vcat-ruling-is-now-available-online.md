If you're interested in reading the full text of the VCAT order on
P1268/2012 (the Dereel NBN tower application) you can find it here:
[McClelland v Golden Plains SC \[2013\] VCAT 749](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VCAT/2013/749.html).
Personally I like the part that says _Although she tabled and spoke to a very
lengthy submission of 53 pages, much of the material has no bearing on the
matters_ and _I will direct that a permit issue_.
