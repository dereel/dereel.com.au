To celebrate all things the community is currently doing, all the volunteers,
all the community groups and initiatives, and to recognise all the hard work so
far, the community are putting on a family friendly community celebration and
market.
 
All community groups in the area have been invited to showcase who they are and
what they do, and demonstrate the strength, creativity and diversity of post
fire Dereel. This is also an opportunity for the many new residents to be
welcomed to their community.
 
Please come along and share our spring celebration, and *Look how far weâ€™ve
come!*

#### Details:

* Saturday 4th of October 2014
* 9am to 3pm
* Dereel Soliders Memorial Hall and Community Centre
