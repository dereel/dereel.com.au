title: "If you are scared of radio waves you should want a mobile tower"

When a mobile phone only has only 1 or 2 bars of signal it has to boost its transmission power by 100 times to connect to the network than what it would transmit at when it has full signal.<!--more--> This is why you notice your phone goes flat faster in Dereel than people's phones in town do, or why your phone never gets the standby time the manufacturer claims (because they measure battery usage in areas of good reception).  That's 100 times as much powerful radio waves right next to your head when you're using your phone or 100 times as much power in your pocket…  To get the same dose of radio waves from a mobile phone tower you would have to be standing closer than 1 metre to it.  You should fear your handset more than any mobile tower, 100 times more.<br>

The truth of the matter is that TV and Radio are responsible for over 98% of all radio waves that pass through your body, mobile phone towers are typically only 20W (compared to 100's of watts for TV and Radio towers) and are responsible for less than 2% of radio waves.  If you are campaigning against mobile towers you had better also be campaigning against TV and Radio towers (and I'd hope you don't have or use a TV or a Radio because that might make you a hypocrite).
