title: "Dereel NBN Tower delayed 6 months"
author: Scott Weston

Even though our council approved the tower it appears at least one resident in our community (I can't imagine who) has lodged a complaint to VCAT.  This means our tower will now be delayed a further 6 months at least.  It's a sad day for those of us who need a broadband solution ASAP but it's just how our planning system works.  As mentioned in previous posts it is <strong>extremely</strong> unlikely that VCAT will rule against our councils decision, it's just a shame that the wheels turn so slowly and we have to wait so long for a decision.  When I get the details of the hearing (date, time and location) I will post them here, VCAT has a public gallery and anyone can attend their hearings.
