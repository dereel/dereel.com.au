As <a href="http://dereel.com.au/2010/07/if-theyre-called-microwaves-cant-they-cook-me/#comment-7">Dale rightly pointed out</a>, it seems like this site is actually only about getting Dereel a mobile tower. While this issue is what moved me to create this website it is my hope that enough people in the community will get involved that it will cover a lot more.  This of course would require people in the community to write posts and submit content and nothing would make me happier than to see this happen.<!--more--> So if you have an event, or an issue or just some information that you want to publish that you think is useful for the Dereel community (and yes I will even happily publish posts from people critical of Dereel getting a mobile tower, I'm not Stalin) then all you need to do is <a href="http://dereel.com.au/wp-login.php?action=register">register for an account on this site</a> then <a href="mailto:scott@westonwire.com.au">send me a message</a> stating you'd like to write content and I'll enable your account to submit posts - I will have to moderate it before it's published (because I don't want to allow spam) but that's all there is to it.  I look forward to seeing what we get.
