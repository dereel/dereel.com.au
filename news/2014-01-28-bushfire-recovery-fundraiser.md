title: Bushfire Recovery Fundraiser
author: Scott Weston

As part of the long recovery process for the Dereel community after the
bushfire last March, the Dereel Community would like to invite you, your
families, friends and networks to CAPTAIN CAT'S THEATRE - a musical play by the
community for the community.
 
An original play, Captain Cat's Theatre is a comedy based around 1880 and
features one of the last bushrangers. All cast, crew and production supporters
are local community members or have strong links to the Dereel community, and
have volunteered their time and talents to provide the wider community with
some respite from the bushfire recovery process (Dereel's as well as other
surrounding fire affected communities) and the coming summer.
 
In addition, all profits from Captain Cat's Theatre will go back into the
Recovery Process to help support other community development initiatives.
 
Please consider supporting this important cause by coming along to one of the
five shows, by sharing this information through your networks, or by an offer
to help in an aspect of the production. To find out more, visit the website
at [www.captaincatstheatre.info](http://www.captaincatstheatre.info/).

To make bookings, please contact Ian on `0408 103 634` or email
`captaincatstheatre@gmail.com`.
