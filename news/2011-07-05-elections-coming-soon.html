I'm sure I'm not the only person to receive a "Budget News" flyer from Darren Cheeseman extolling all the good things he has done and is doing, none of which apply to me.  Does this herald a new federal election?<br>
<br>
Now is probably the time to remind him of the "progress" that the National Broadband Network has made in Dereel.  Until last week we had the remote hope of good WiMAX wireless networking (nearly as good as ADSL).  But the NBN has scrapped that, and all they will subsidise is satellite.  I wrote Darren a <a href="http://www.lemis.com/grog//Day/20100730/Cheeseman.u7u.pdf">letter</a> about this last year, to which (uniquely for politicians) I received no reply.  I've sent him <a href="http://www.lemis.com/grog/Day/20110705/Cheeseman.v75.pdf">another one</a> today.  Clearly the more who jump on this bandwagon, the more he's likely to listen.<br>
