Come and support this excellent local event. If you don't have tickets don't fret as they are available at the gates from 11:30am. More information is available at <a href="http://www.warrambeenfilmfestival.com.au/">their website</a>. If you don't want to believe me then perhaps Hugh Jackman can convince you: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKp2xM-6_9s">Hugh Jackman supports Warrambeen Film Festival</a>
