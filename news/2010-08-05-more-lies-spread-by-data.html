Wendy McClelland has written a letter to the editor of the Miner that is full of untruths.<!--more--><br>
<br>
I'm going to ignore all the misunderstandings of the difference between radio waves, microwaves and megahertz - it's already clear Wendy has absolutely no understanding of the physics of radio waves, that's been covered to death.<br>
<br>
Here is the truth, I have spoken directly to Optus and Telstra about the tower in Corindhap and both have admitted that the tower there will in no way cover Dereel, there are too many hills in the way. I advise any Dereel residents to contact Optus or Telstra to learn the truth. Wendy is not speaking from a position of authority, she is lying to you to try and convince you a tower is not needed in Dereel based on no proof.<br>
<br>
Also, the ALP have released detailed maps on which towns will be getting fibre optically connected to the NBN, Dereel is not on the list. Dereel will not be getting fibre optics and in any case the fibre optic cables does not in any way address the issue of mobile phone coverage. We don't want the tower to gain access to the internet, we want it so we can use our mobile phones. Again Wendy has no idea what she is talking about.<br>
<br>
There is also a big difference between understanding fellow neighbours valid concerns about a tower in their backyard and wanting a tower for the community in a location that is more acceptable to all. This woman seems to think that that means I'm admitting towers cause health problems, it does not, it just means that unlike her I care about others in my community and I'm willing to make comprises for them - unlike Wendy who wants to dictate to you what you can and can't do with your life based on her completely unfounded concerns.<br>
<br>
Dereel will get a tower, Wendy will fail.
