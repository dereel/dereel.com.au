title: "How to make your tower support official"
author: Scott Weston

I have setup a simple form that Dereel residents can fill in to have their support for a tower added to the planning permission. Simply <a href="http://dereel.com.au/tower-support/">fill in the support form</a> and click send, I will then include your letter of support for the tower to a community support pack and then give it to Telstra and Optus. You can also fill the form in on behalf of friends and neighbours that don't have internet connectivity but please do get their permission first.<br>
<br>
If you prefer not to use the form you can of course still <a href="mailto:scott@westonwire.com.au">email me your letters of support</a>.
