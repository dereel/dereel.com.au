We've just found a dog which came to our property in Kleins Road (just west of the lagoon).  He's a friendly bloke, and he looks a little like a Jack Russell.  No identification.  Photos  <a href="http://www.lemis.com/grog/photos/Photos.php?dirdate=20120411">here</a>.  If you know him, please contact me at 5346 1370.<br>
