title: Mt Mercer Wind Farm Update

If you haven't been on the Mt Mercer/Shelford road in a while you're missing
some pretty impressive engineering being done nearby. Cranes are on site and
they're getting close to erecting the first turbine (hopefully by the end of
the month).

Keep up to date via the [Mt Mercer Wind Farm Website](http://mtmercerwindfarm.com.au/news/latest-info) or look out for monthly update flyers in local shops and cafes. I've included a
copy of the August update below so you can have an idea of the quality information
they are posting.

This wind farm is being built just 10km west of Dereel and will generate enough
power to power all the homes in Ballarat.
