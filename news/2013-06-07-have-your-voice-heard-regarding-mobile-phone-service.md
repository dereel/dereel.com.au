title: Have your voice heard regarding mobile phone service in Dereel
author: Scott Weston
---

Residents of Dereel that would like Telstra mobile phone service please send a
letter to the Golden Plains Shire stating that you require mobile phone service
(no need to go into details, a single sentence of _"I want mobile phone service
in Dereel"_ will suffice).

Post it to:

    TELSTRA MOBILE SERVICE IN DEREEL
    c/o Golden Plains Shire Council
    PO Box 111
    Bannockburn Victoria
    3331

or you can email your support to [Jenny Blake](mailto:cr.jblake@gplains.vic.gov.au?subject=TELSTRA+MOBILE+SERVICE+IN+DEREEL)
(again simply state _"I want mobile phone service in Dereel"_ with the subject
_"TELSTRA MOBILE SERVICE IN DEREEL"_).

I have of course forwarded the community support I collected back in
2010 but more support or reasserting your support isn't going to hurt.
