Our community will soon (within 2 years) have a 131MW windfarm. Meridian Energy have released a press release stating that construction of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Mercer_Wind_Farm">Mount Mercer Wind Farm</a> will begin in December of 2012.<!--more--><br>

<strong>Meridian to build Mt Mercer wind farm</strong><br>
For immediate release: 3 September 2012<br>
<br>
Meridian Energy Australia will commence construction of the Mt Mercer wind farm in December this year and will take about two years to complete. Meridian Australia's Project Director, Wes Ferguson said the wind farm, with 64 turbines, will provide sufficient renewable energy to meet the electricity needs of the entire population of Ballarat and will have a capital cost of around AUD $260 million. "The project will employ around 200 people during construction and upon completion it will provide about 20 permanent jobs in the local region. There will also be other external jobs in the local community for the supply chain, such as ongoing maintenance," Mr Ferguson said.<br>
<br>
"During construction, Meridian will continue to engage the local community to ensure that the benefits of the wind farm are maximised and any impacts minimised." The 131MW Mt Mercer wind farm occupies seven conjoint landholdings (2,460 hectares). This land will continue to be used for cropping, sheep, cattle and pig farming.<br>
<br>
Meridian Energy Australia - a wholly owned subsidiary of Meridian Energy Limited - bought the consents for Mt Mercer in April 2009 and will be Meridian's third wind farm in Australia.<br>
<br>
The wind farm will be connected to the Victorian Electricity Grid by a new powerline and green field terminal station near the town of Elaine. This connection will be built, owned and operated by Transmission Operations (Australia), which has the same majority owners as distribution companies Powercor/Citipower.<br>
<br>
Mr Furguson says the competitive National Electricity Market, combined with the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (requiring approximately one fifth of electricity generation to be from renewable sources by 2020), is enabling renewable energy to be delivered for all Australians on a low cost and efficient basis.<br>
<br>
"Our job is to deliver efficient sources of renewable energy to the market and assist electricity retailers to meet the MRET liabilities, improve choice and price for Australian electricity consumers," Mr Ferguson said.<br>
<br>
"We're excited to be proceeding with Mt Mercer with the support of our partners - REpower Systems SE, Downer EDI and Transmissions Operations (Australia)."<br>
<br>
Meridian Australia Chief Executive Ben Burge says that "with a capital cost of around AUD $260 million, the Mt Mercer project increases Meridian's existing presence in Australia and further leverages Meridian's proven experience in designing and managing the construction of new wind farms in some of the toughest terrains on the planet."<br>
