Here is what <a href="http://savedereel.com/">DATA</a> open with:<br>
<blockquote><strong>This is not about radio waves </strong>which have been around for decades and are used for radio communications.</blockquote><br>
The simple fact is that it is about radio waves, microwaves are merely a subset of radio waves between the frequencies of 300MHz and 300GHz whereas the term radio waves describes all electromagnetic frequencies below infrared (thus it does include microwaves).<!--more--> This very basic misunderstanding of the facts is then continued throughout the <a href="http://savedereel.com/">DATA</a> flyer.<br>
<br>
One thing that <a href="http://savedereel.com/">DATA</a> did mention is the mobile tower that was recently erected in Haddon. The members of <a href="http://savedereel.com/">DATA</a> who are attempting to block the installation of the tower here in Dereel also attempted to block the tower in Haddon - they were completely unsuccessful and common sense won.  I guarantee they will be just as unsuccessful at blocking the installation of a tower here in Dereel and that common sense again will beat <a href="http://savedereel.com/">DATA</a>'s lack of reason and lack of data. They may be loud but they have no evidence to back up their claims and instead just attack what they don't understand, they mislead, they quote out of context and they down right lie.<br>
<br>
You have to worry about a group who are so insecure about what they believe that they don't allow people to make comments on their website and they don't link to the opposition.  I have no worries about linking to <a href="http://savedereel.com">DATA</a>'s website and welcome everyone to read it, more importantly ask your kids to read it because even a child with high school physics will be able to point out the glaring errors.
