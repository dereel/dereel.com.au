<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/local/audio/2012/02/13/3429284.htm">Listen to an actual expert in the field</a> on the ABC website as broadcast on ABC Ballarat recently.  Yet again it is said that Mobile phone towers are not of concern and it is the use of mobile phones up against your head that you should be concerned about (if you're concern at all, personally I'm not).  Yet more proof that Wendy should <strong>not</strong> be blocking our tower all she needs to do is never use a mobile phone or have an NBN device attached to her house - two things she can choose to do while not stopping the rest of her community access to important services.
