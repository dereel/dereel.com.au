It's becoming a bore but Wendy McClelland has stuffed our mail boxes with another lie filled rant about mobile phone towers - only this time including personal attacks against myself and <a href="http://www.lemis.com/grog/">Greg</a>.  As I said I will no longer enter into discussion with Wendy because she is clearly unable to <a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/2011/how-to-have-a-rational-discussion/" target="_blank">rationally discuss things like an adult</a>.  I have attached scans of her rambling inconsistent arguments after the break for your amusement (and to document her descent into madness).  Enjoy!<!--more--><br>
