title: Domain squatters put value on savedereel.com

After the Dereel Anti-Tower Alliance (DATA) let their domain (savedereel.com)
lapse it appears domain squatters have pounced on it. Out of interest I
contacted the domain squatters to find out how much they were asking for the
domain (I would never entertain the idea of dealing with a domain squatter but
I was interested in their valuation), here is the response I got:

<blockquote>
<p>The owner of this domain has responded with a asking price set at $1250 USD.
To make an offer, reply to this email with the offer you would like me to present to the owner of the domain.</p>
</blockquote>

So it appears DATA were sitting on a little gold mine! Shame they abandoned it so quickly after
losing their fight.
