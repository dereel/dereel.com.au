title: Here come the comments

It turns out [Disqus](http://disqus.com) supports importing comments from Wordpress. I've been running
the import now for a few days (Disqus are having some issues causing delays on imports) and we can
see that about 80% of the comment are now imported correctly. We can assume that the rest of the comments
will be imported over the course of the next 24 hours.
