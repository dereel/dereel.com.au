Here's some classic crazy from 2005.<a href="http://dereel.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/WendyMcClellandCantReadMultimeters.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-378" title="WendyMcClellandCantReadMultimeters" src="http://dereel.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/WendyMcClellandCantReadMultimeters.png" alt="" width="732" height="468" /></a>No Wendy, even a high-schooler can tell you that no reading means <strong>INFINITE</strong> resistance but don't let the facts get in the way of a good scare story, eh Wendy? Of course not, better to spin yarns and get people all afraid of the big invisible radiation monster that is going to kill everyone.  Because as we all know, once Telstra and Optus have killed us all that's when they'll be able to make their biggest profits. In any case 'resistance' here doesn't mean what you think it means, english is a difficult language to grasp - sometimes words have two or more meanings!
