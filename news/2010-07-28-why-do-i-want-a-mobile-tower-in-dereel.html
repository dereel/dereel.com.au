The only difference is my fear is real. My family has lived in Dereel for over 20 years, in February of 1995 the Enfield forest caught fire. It destroyed homes in Berringa and it threatened to destroy homes in Dereel, including ours.<!--more--><br>
<br>
In total 10,000 hectares was burned and nine houses were lost. It was by far the most terrifying time in my life. The CFA were using our dam as a filling point as the fire headed towards Dereel. Trucks and helicopters were everywhere. Eventually the fire reached our home and all the members of my family fought it - but we didn't for a second imagine we'd win, our car was packed and if the fire took hold of our home or threatened to block our escape route we would have evacuated.<br>
<br>
<a rel="lightbox-fire" href="http://dereel.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/firecrop05.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-176" title="firecrop05" src="http://dereel.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/firecrop05-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="122" /></a><br>
<br>
I think back to that time and think we were fool hardy and that we were just lucky that the CFA were so near our home when it needed protection. It wasn't good planning that kept us alive and our home safe - it was mostly luck. If another fire threaten would we do it again? I doubt it. At the time our family consisted of 4 strong boys and their parents but 15 years on that's no longer the case. No, if a fire threatened our home again we'd pack up and leave.<br>
<br>
So now my thoughts turn to how would we safely evacuate? Obviously we'd pack our cars with what belongings and pets we could and head off but once we leave the home how are we going to communicate? What if we get separated while evacuating? What if a car breaks down during the evacuation or the fire changes directions and makes a road impassable? What if...<br>
<br>
There are lots of nice and happy reasons to want a mobile phone tower in Dereel but for me it's the reasons I can't think of that matter the most. I hope I never have to use my mobile phone for an emergency ever again in my life, but I will fight tooth and nail to ensure the service is there just in case I do. Fire has killed more people and animals and destroyed more homes than electromagnetic hypersensitivity ever has. If a tower in Dereel saved even 1 life it would be worth every penny.<br>
<br>
Of all the towns in Victoria there is only 52 listed as being at extreme risk of being destroyed by bush fire, Dereel is one of those. Of those 52 only a handful have no designated evacuation point, Dereel is one of those. How safe do you feel not having mobile phone coverage?<br>
