title: "DATA's feeble rebuttal"
author: Scott Weston

DATA have posted a letter of rebuttal to my letter to the editor of The Miner, they have posted it outside the Dereel town hall.<!--more--><a href="http://dereel.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IMAG0210.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-344" title="DATA's feeble rebuttal" src="http://dereel.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IMAG0210-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>It appears now that DATA are resorting to legal threats to silence free speech. Well I wait patiently to receive their writ's and will fight them to the fullest extent of the law. Of course it's all just hot air and an attempt to get me to back down because DATA know they're losing.<br>
<br>
This time DATA quote an "expert" who (and this is their own words) "is a Victorian distributor for german company YSheild".  YSheild is a company that sells expensive paint to protect your from radio waves. He can tell you of "thousands of sick people" he has helped. Well of course he can, he sells them the cure to the illness he also tells them they have. Well that doesn't make him independent or trustworthy does it, he has a vested interest to further the myth about radio waves because he directly makes money from it.<br>
<br>
They also refer to John Patterson who just happens to work for EMR Australia, who just happen to make money from consulting about reducing exposure to... you guessed it: radio waves. Another "expert" who makes a living from spreading the myth that radio waves are dangerous. Why can't DATA find a single independent reputable doctor or engineer to back up their case? Because it's a tissue of lies.<br>
<br>
If I knocked on your door and told you that deadly space radiation was slowly killing you but don't worry because I have a tonic that will protect you for the small price of $100, would you believe me and buy it? Well that's exactly what YSheild are doing.<br>
<br>
They also make the claim that the tower in Smythesdale is 16kms from Dereel. Anyone with a map can see that's not true (it's 20kms at the minimum) but look to the north west next time you're outside, yes there are hills in the way. Again DATA are telling easily disprovable porky pies. They claim that reception from the tower works in the northern parts of Dereel, well I live at the very northern tip of Dereel and I don't get mobile phone reception. So yet again, another easily proven lie.<br>
<br>
And lastly they quote from a disgraced doctor who is claimed was forced to leave the WHO because he was accepting bribes (although I can find no evidence to prove this, only hearsay). Well he sounds like a really trustworthy fellow.<br>
<br>
DATA are a joke.
