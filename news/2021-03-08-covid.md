We are hopefully putting a lid on COVID but it's no time to be complacent. Please
keep following the remaining restrictions and be sure to get vaccinated when you
finally get the opportunity.

Don't forget that the [Golden Plains Shire](https://www.goldenplains.vic.gov.au) has
a [Coronavirus information page](https://www.goldenplains.vic.gov.au/coronavirus) for
quick local information.
