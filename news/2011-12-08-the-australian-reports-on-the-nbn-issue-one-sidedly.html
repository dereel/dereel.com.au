title: "\"The Australian\" reports on the NBN issue, one-sidedly"
author: Greg Lehey

The Australian has published <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/in-depth/townsfolk-reject-wireless-nbn/story-e6frgaif-1226216696170">this article</a> about Wendy and friends' objections to the NBN.  It's very light on detail, and though I get a mention, it's swayed somewhat.  In particular, it seems to imply that I agree with Wendy and doesn't mention that it's clear that we won't get fibre any time soon, one way or another.  Still, from the photo it seems that there really are more than 4 people in agreement with "DATA".<br>
