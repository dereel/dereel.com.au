title: The Courier is coming to see our support for mobile phone services
author: Scott Weston

This Thursday (25th of July) The Courier will be attending a show of
support being held at the Community Hall at lunch time (around 12 to
12:30pm). Obviously we already have a tower approved (the NBN tower)
but if the community really pushes it while we have the governments
attention we can get the mobile phone providers to colocate their
services on the same tower.

I have it on good authority that the NBN tower is being built as quickly
as possible and currently contracts are being made and signed before
ground work can start but it won't hurt to make sure the mobile phone
providers are ready to use it as soon as possible and that we get as much
press as we can.
