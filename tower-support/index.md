## Tower Support

Thank you to everyone who used this website to show their support for a communications tower
to be built in Dereel. Planning application for a tower has now been made by NBNco and was
unanimously approved by Golden Plains Shire Council on March 27th, 2012.

A single resident of Dereel lodged an objection to VCAT which meant the tower application has
been in limbo until April 24th, 2013 when it had its hearing day.

We are currently awaiting the chairman to visit the proposed site to gauge visual impact after
which he will deliver his verdict.

It is extremely unlikely that VCAT will overturn our councils approval and construction of
our tower should begin within 6 weeks.

We won.
