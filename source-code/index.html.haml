  Now browse to [http://localhost:4242](http://localhost:4242) to view the
  development site. If you're running awestruct on a remote host you can add
  `--url http://a.b.c.d:4242` to the launch of the development server and then
  browse to that address once the server has started. For example if you are
  using a server on your local network to run awestruct but are ssh'd in from a
  laptop you could start awestruct like follows:

      $ awestruct -d --force --url http://192.168.1.200:4242

  And then browse to [http://192.168.1.200:4242](http://192.168.1.200:4242) to
  see the site. There is still an outstanding bug in awestruct v0.5.0 where it
  will output: 

      Generating site: http://localhost:4242

  even when you supply a different URL, simply ignore it - it will use the
  correct base_url.

  You need Ruby1.9 or greated because the `Atomizer` extension requires
  `Datetime.xmlschema()` which was introduced in Ruby1.9. If you must run on
  Ruby1.8 then you will need to disable the Atomizer by commenting the
  following line in `_ext/pipeline.rb`:

      extension Awestruct::Extensions::Atomizer.new(:posts, '/news/atom.xml', :feed_title=>'dereel.com.au')

  If you do not comment out the `Atomizer` you will get the following error:

      NoMethodError: undefined method `xmlschema' for DateTime:Class

  ### How to submit content

  After checking out the dereel source code create a file in the `news/`
  directory using the following format:

      YYYY-MM-DD-a-url-safe-unique-title-similar-to-posts-title.md

  Where `YYYY` is the current year and `MM` and `DD` are the month and date 0
  padded.  Then in that file put the following contents:

      ---
      layout: post
      title: My more fancy title
      author: Your Name
      ---
      My excellent post written using the [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) markdown language.

  You can replace the extention of the file (`.md`) with `.html.haml` if you
  want to use `haml` or `.html.textile` if you prefer `textile` markdown. Also
  be aware that the text between the `---` lines is YAML and so you will need
  to put text containing `:` in quotes (`"`) and if you do that then escape any
  `"`'s

  Once you've created your post file add it to git (assuming you're in the
  `news/` directory):

      $ git add YYYY-MM-DD-a-url-safe-unique-title-similar-to-posts-title.md

  Now launch the development server and check that the file compiles and
  renders correctly, this needs to done from the top of the repository (ie. one
  directory above `news/`):

      $ cd ..
      $ awestruct -d --force
        [ browse to http://localhost:4242 and check you post ]

  Once you are happy with your new post you can submit it back into Github
  (after I've added you as a collaborator) where it will be deployed the next
  time the website is updated:

      $ git commit -a
        [ add a short description of the change, e.g. "add news about ___" ]
      $ git push
        [ enter your Github username and password ]

  After this is complete I will receive an email notifying me of the commit and
  I will endevour to deploy your change to the server as soon as possible.

  ### Getting added as a Collaborator

  Simply send me an email (`scott at dereel dot com dot au`) requesting to be a
  collaborator and tell me what your [Github](http://github.com) username is.
  You can of course fork the Dereel project and submit your changes to your own
  fork and then send me a pull request to merge them.
